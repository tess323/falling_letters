Falling Letters:

Practice your typing by striking the coresponding letter as they fall.  There are two levels - a light breeze and strong gusts!  Letters fall slower with a light breeze and much faster with strong gusts.  

Process:

I was hoping to use this as a chance to create a polished project with DRY code that allowed me to practice Jquery animation, which I had not made it to on previous homework assignments.  By far the hardest aspect of this project was using the keyup function and codeKey.


Next steps:

I would like to add another level to this game that is randomized scrolling words.  I have begun work on this, but it wasn't polished enough for presentation.  I hope to include it in my final portfolio.
